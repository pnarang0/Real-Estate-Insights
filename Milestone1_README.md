# Milestone 1: Data Cleaning & EDA

This notebook covers the initial data preparation and exploratory analysis of a housing dataset sourced from Kaggle (India). The dataset includes information on home features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, air conditioning, hot water heating, furnishing status, and price.

## Key Activities:
- Checked and confirmed no missing values.
- Categorical variables transformed using one-hot encoding.
- Conducted EDA using visualizations and correlation heatmaps.
- Identified high-impact features: area, bathrooms, AC, heating, furnishing.

## Target Audience:
Real estate agents and property consultants seeking data-driven insights to price and market homes more effectively.

## Dataset Info:
- Source: Kaggle housing dataset (India)
- Currency: Indian Rupees (â‚¹ INR)
- Data File: `Housing.csv` (included in repo)

## Reflection:
In this milestone, I focused on preparing and exploring the dataset to identify which features influence property prices the most. Cleaning the data and encoding it properly was crucial for accurate analysis. Visual patterns confirmed the importance of amenities and size in determining property value. The insights are designed to be practical and useful for real estate professionals.
